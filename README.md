I analyzed this dataset on electricity supply and usage using Excel and Power BI to uncover key insights. The analysis highlighted trends in power outages, state-by-state energy supply, usage, and losses. Lagos led in electricity supply and usage, while Kaduna reported the highest energy loss. I also observed a steady improvement in power reliability, with outages decreasing month by month. The findings emphasize the need to address energy losses, enhance supply utilization, and ensure equitable distribution across regions.

This Analysis reveals that the total electricity supplied is 277K units, which is significantly lower than the potential capacity of 554K units. This indicates that there is a substantial gap between the available resources and their actual utilization, pointing to opportunities for improvement in distribution or generation capacity.

The analysis highlights the performance of specific states in terms of electricity supply and usage. Lagos emerges as the leader, with the highest electricity supply of 63K units and the highest usage of 56K units. This reflects Lagos' status as a key economic hub with substantial energy demands. Abuja and Kano follow closely, with supply levels of 58K and 52K units, respectively, and usage levels of 52K and 44K units. On the other hand, Enugu records the lowest supply and usage, at 28K and 23K units, respectively, highlighting a potential area for investment to meet energy needs.

Energy losses across states paint a concerning picture. Kaduna experiences the highest energy loss at 212 units, followed by Kano and Enugu, both at 181 units. These significant losses could indicate inefficiencies in the transmission or distribution networks, particularly in these states. Abuja records the lowest energy loss at 112 units, suggesting relatively better efficiency in its electricity infrastructure.

Another critical insight from this analysis is the trend of average power outages over the months, the data shows a steady improvement in power reliability, with outages declining from 22.67 hours in June to 12.17 hours in May. This trend reflects progress in efforts to stabilize the electricity supply, likely due to enhanced grid management or infrastructure upgrades.
